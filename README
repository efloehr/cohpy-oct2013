These are the files from my October 2013 Central Ohio Python Users Group meeting.

This presentation was an introduction to Python image processing using PIL and
matplotlib. It also talked a little about some nifty Python features like the
enummerate built-in.

You will need PIL, matplotlib, and ImageMagick (at least on Linux) to
run these programs.

For PIL, I would recommend the pillow fork, as it is the more maintained
version.

To make a movie out of the individual images generated, I ran ffmpeg
with defaults:

ffmpeg -i done/%d.png movie.mp4
